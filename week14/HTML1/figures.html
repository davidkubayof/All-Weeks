      The mystery drew in two people: Clara, Mr. Weaver’s curious granddaughter,
      and Detective Miller, an old friend of the family. Clara knew her
      grandfather was secretive, but Miller suspected something more. Together,
      they entered the silent shop. As Clara touched the golden watch, the hands
      began to spin backward at a blurred speed, and the room grew suddenly
      cold.

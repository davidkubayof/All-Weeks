      Mr. Weaver left behind more than just a shop. In the back room, they found
      a massive wall covered in thousands of tiny keys, each labeled with a
      different year. On his desk lay a final letter addressed to Clara. It
      contained no words, only a hand-drawn map of the stars and a small, silver
      key that didn't match any of the locks on the wall.
